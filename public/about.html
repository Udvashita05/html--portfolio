<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Udvashita Banerjee, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) 
  degree in Information Technology from Techno Main Salt Lake. I have always been passionate about technology
   and problem-solving, which led me to choose this field of study. Throughout my academic journey, I have been
    exploring various domains within IT, 
  gaining a strong foundation in programming, data structures, and software development.</p>

<p>Currently, I am focusing on learning web development, a field that greatly interests me because of its creativity and real-world impact. I am gaining hands-on experience with front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and gradually moving towards back-end development using tools such as Node.js and Express. Building responsive,
   user-friendly websites excites me, and I enjoy the process of turning ideas
    into interactive digital experiences.</p>

<p>As I continue to grow in this area, I aim to develop a
   well-rounded skill set that combines both technical knowledge 
   and design thinking. I believe that web development offers endless 
   opportunities for innovation, and I am eager to contribute to meaningful 
   projects in the future. My goal is to become a proficient full-stack developer 
   and be part of a dynamic tech community where I can keep learning and improving.
